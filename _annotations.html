  <h1>Contract ABI</h1>
  <p>
    Although it is possible to parse <code>pwasm_ethereum::input()</code> manually and handle multiple methods of your contract it would be extremely cumbersome.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>pwasm-abi-derive</code> crate allows you to easily define your contracts methods and automatically dispatch the calls.
